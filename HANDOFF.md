# Job-Assistant ("Alicia AI") — Engineering Handoff

## Update 2026-07-06 (latest) — v1.8.3: Workday multi-select prompt fields (Phase 2d)

Workday multi-select fields (Skills, Languages, multi-pick "how did you hear") are a typed input
inside `[data-automation-id="multiSelectContainer"]` whose picks render as chips
(`[data-automation-id="selectedItem"]`) — NOT a `button[aria-haspopup="listbox"]`, so neither the
single-select fill nor the single-select discovery saw them. Phase 2d wires them into the same
custom-question pipeline, answering multiple values.

**`autofill.js`:**
- `wdFindMultiselectQuestions(eeo)` discovers each visible, empty (no chips), non-EEO multiselect
  container with a labelled input and emits a custom-question item with **`multi: true`**,
  `type:'text'`, `options:[]`.
- `callCustomAnswerBackend` formats `multi` items as **"[list one or more values from the resume,
  comma-separated]"** (the truthful/resume-only system prompt is unchanged — no invented skills).
- `wdAddMultiValues(container, answerText)` (the item's `apply`) splits the answer on `,`/`;`/newline
  and, for each value, types it into the multiselect input, waits for the promptOption list, and
  clicks the best match (≥45) to add a chip; unmatched values are cleared so no stray text lingers.
- `getValue` reads the chip texts joined by ", " — so the human's reviewed/edited set is what gets
  learned on the confirm click.
- `wdFindDropdownQuestions` now appends the multiselect results to the single-select results (one
  hook, shared `CUSTOM_QA_MAX_PER_STEP` cap). Disjoint from the single-select scan (that scans
  `button[aria-haspopup="listbox"]`; multiselects use an input), and `wdFillDropdowns` skips inputs,
  so no double-handling.

**Safety:** multiselect answers are AI-generated from resume facts and, like all AI answers, **pause
for human review** before Submit (the human can remove chips) — consistent with the never-auto-submit,
never-invent guardrails. EEO/demographic multiselects are excluded.

**Verified:** `node --check` clean; unit tests pass for value splitting (`,`/`;`/newline), the
multi prompt label, apply match/no-match, and the chip `getValue` join. **Live load test still
needed** for the real type→list→click-chip cycle and multi-value adds on a Workday Skills/Languages
field.

**Remaining Workday gaps:** none tracked beyond tuning (search wait time under heavy latency). The
Workday adapter now covers standard fields, EEO, account gate + verify wall, single-select
(enumerated + searchable) and multi-select prompt questions.

## Update 2026-07-06 — v1.8.2: Workday searchable dropdowns / type-to-search (Phase 2c)

Workday has two dropdown kinds: small enumerated lists (render options immediately) and SEARCHABLE
lists — Country, School, State/Province — that render NOTHING until you type. Phases 2/2b handled
only the first kind; searchable ones came back empty and were skipped. Phase 2c adds type-to-search
and folds all the dropdown open/pick logic into one primitive.

**`wdPickOption(trigger, desired)` (`autofill.js`) — the single open→pick primitive now:**
- Opens the dropdown; if no `promptOption` items render, it finds the popup's search box
  (`wdSearchBox`: `input[data-automation-id="searchBox"]` + fallbacks), types `desired`, waits for
  the list to filter, then picks the best-scoring option (≥45). Escapes closed on no match.
- Both `wdFillDropdowns` (EEO/State/Country) and the custom-question `apply` closures call it, so
  enumerated AND searchable dropdowns go through the exact same path. `wdSelectAnswer` was removed
  (folded in).

**Standard-field dropdowns from the profile:** `wdFillDropdowns(eeo, profile)` now also fills
**State/Province** and **Country** from `profile` (previously EEO-only). Gotcha baked in: Workday's
State field is usually `formField-countryRegion`, so the state check (`/state|province|region/`) runs
BEFORE the country check and matches "region" — routing `countryRegion` to `profile.state`, not
country. (`profile` has no `country` field today, so Country only fills if one is added later.)

**Searchable custom questions:** `wdReadOptions` now returns `{ options, searchable }`.
`wdFindDropdownQuestions` emits enumerated dropdowns as `type:'select'` (AI must return an exact
option) and searchable ones as `type:'text'` with `options:[]` (AI returns the value; `apply` types
it into the search box and picks). Empty-non-searchable and absurdly-long (>30) lists are still left
for the human.

**Signature change:** the `fillDropdowns` adapter hook is now `fillDropdowns(eeo, profile)` (was
`(eeo)`); the call site passes `profile`. Generic adapter doesn't implement it, so no impact there.

**Verified:** `node --check` clean; unit tests pass for the desired-value routing (gender→pref,
`countryRegion`→state, pure country→country, address/phone-type→skip) and the searchable
classification (enumerated→select, empty+searchbox→text, empty→skip, >30→skip). **Live load test
still needed** for the real type-into-search-box→filter→pick cycle on Workday Country/School/State.

**Remaining Workday gaps:** multi-select prompt fields (skills/languages that accept several picks)
aren't handled — only single-select. Network-latency-heavy searches may need a longer wait than the
750ms in `wdPickOption`.

## Update 2026-07-06 (later) — v1.8.1: Workday prompt-option questions → AI answer flow (Phase 2b)

Workday's NON-EEO question dropdowns now flow through the same learned-bank → batched-AI →
learn-from-human pipeline as native `<select>`/radio/text questions. Before this, only real
`<select>`, radio groups, and text inputs were discovered by `findUnansweredCustomQuestions`, so
Workday's button+portaled-listbox dropdowns ("How did you hear about us?", "Highest level of
education", yes/no eligibility questions, etc.) were silently skipped.

**How it works (`autofill.js`):**
- New adapter hook **`findDropdownQuestions(eeo)`** (async), wired into `fillOnePass` right after the
  generic `findUnansweredCustomQuestions` and concatenated into the same `items` list (capped at
  `CUSTOM_QA_MAX_PER_STEP`). Only Workday implements it (`wdFindDropdownQuestions`).
- Custom-question **items can now carry their own `apply(answerText)` (async) + `getValue()`**.
  `applyAnswerToItem` is now `async` and short-circuits to `item.apply` when present; `itemFinalValue`
  short-circuits to `item.getValue`. Both `applyAnswerToItem` call sites (learned loop + AI loop)
  were converted from `forEach` to `await`-ing `for` loops. Generic select/radio/text items are
  unchanged (no `apply`/`getValue` → same code path as before).
- `wdFindDropdownQuestions`: for each `button[aria-haspopup="listbox"]` that is empty, non-EEO, and
  has a question-like label (≥2 words or `?`; single-word selects like Country/State are left for the
  human), it OPENS the dropdown to read the `[data-automation-id="promptOption"]` labels (Workday only
  renders them while open), closes it, and — if 2–30 options — emits a `type:'select'` item whose
  `apply` re-opens and picks the best-scoring option and whose `getValue` reads the trigger text.
  **EEO/demographic dropdowns are excluded** (they're filled from saved prefs by `wdFillDropdowns`;
  we never AI-guess demographics). Searchable dropdowns render no options until you type, so they come
  back empty (>30 or 0) and are left for the human — a known Phase-2c follow-up.

**Verified:** `node --check` clean; unit tests pass for the discovery gating (include "how did you
hear"/"education"; skip EEO, already-answered, single-word, and empty/searchable) and for the async
`apply`/`getValue` routing (routed + awaited). **Live load test still needed** for the real
open→read→close→reopen→pick cycle on a Workday questions page.

## Update 2026-07-06 — v1.8.0: external-ATS adapter framework + auto-detect offer

Expanded external-ATS autofill from one generic pass into a **detector → adapter** architecture,
plus an auto-detect entry point so an application can be filled on a company/ATS site without
opening the side panel. Shipped in three phases; all on the same free backend, still never
auto-submits the final Apply.

**Phase 1 — adapter seam + auto-detect/offer (`autofill.js`, new `detect.js`, `background.js`):**
- `detectATS()` returns `workday | greenhouse | lever | generic` (hostname + DOM signature);
  `ADAPTERS` is the registry. An **empty adapter `{}` is byte-for-byte the old generic engine** —
  the refactor is a pure seam, no behavior change on unknown sites. The main run resolves
  `adapter = ADAPTERS[detectATS()]`, routes dropdown fill + advance/stop lookups through it, and
  sets `result.ats`. Hook interface (all optional, generic fallback if omitted):
  `fillDropdowns(eeo)`, `fillTypeaheads(profile)`, `blockingWall()`, `advancePatterns`,
  `stopPatterns` — documented in a comment block above the registry.
- **`detect.js` (NEW):** a tiny offer script. `background.js` injects it on a completed load of a
  known-ATS host (scoped to `ATS_HOST_RE`, so it NEVER runs on arbitrary sites the user browses)
  when there's no active session for the tab and the host wasn't dismissed in the last 6h. It
  checks for a real application form (same signal as `hasRecognizedForm`) and floats
  "⚡ Auto-fill this application?". **Accept** messages `ATS_OFFER_ACCEPT` → background starts the
  exact same `autofillSessions` flow the manual button uses (so re-injection + `UNIVERSAL_FILL_RESULT`
  reporting already work). **Not now** → `ATS_OFFER_DISMISS` records the host (in-memory; a worker
  restart may re-offer — harmless). No manifest change: `scripting` + `<all_urls>` already allow
  programmatic injection, so no re-accept prompt on reload.

**Phase 2 — Workday adapter (`wdFillDropdowns`, `wdBlockingWall`, `WD_ADVANCE`/`WD_STOP`):**
- **Prompt-option dropdowns:** Workday dropdowns are a `button[aria-haspopup="listbox"]` opening a
  PORTALED list of `[data-automation-id="promptOption"]` (`data-automation-label` = option text) at
  the end of `<body>` — not `<select>` and not `role=option`. `wdFillDropdowns` opens EEO/known ones
  (matched via the `formField-*` container id + label → `eeoKey`), scores options, picks or Escapes.
  Runs before the generic combobox pass; unknown dropdowns are left for the human (Phase 2 scope).
- **Account gate (auto-submit, per Jordon's call):** on the create-account page it ticks ONLY the
  agreement checkbox (by `data-automation-id`/agree-terms label, or the sole checkbox — avoids
  marketing opt-ins); generic `fillPasswordFields` fills both password + verifyPassword with the same
  generated value so they match; **"Create Account" is auto-clicked** (it's in `WD_ADVANCE`, removed
  from `WD_STOP`). The final application **Submit is still never auto-clicked.**
- **Email-verification wall:** `wdBlockingWall()` detects the post-create-account verify screen
  (verify phrases + essentially no form) and stops with a clear banner. Checked at run start AND at
  the top of each wizard step, because Create Account triggers a real page nav that re-injects and
  re-runs `autofill.js`.

**Phase 3 — Greenhouse + Lever adapters (`atsFillLocationTypeahead`):**
- Both are single-page forms already handled by the generic engine (standard fields, EEO selects,
  custom questions; generic stop patterns catch "Submit Application"). No pattern override, no gate.
- Their one shared generic gap is the **location autocomplete** — generic types the city but never
  picks the suggestion, which can fail validation. `atsFillLocationTypeahead` types "City, State" and
  picks the first suggestion (`.pac-item`, listbox options, Greenhouse's dropdown). **On pick-failure
  it leaves the typed value = identical to generic, so it can only help, never regress.**

**Verification (this session):** `node --check` clean on all JS + valid `manifest.json`; unit tests
pass for host detection, Workday advance/stop routing + `eeoKey` on `formField-*` ids + wall phrases,
and Greenhouse/Lever field matching + the location signal. **Still needs Jordon's live load test** for
the interactive DOM (Workday dropdown pick, GH/Lever location pick, offer→fill handoff) — the
`promptOption`/suggestion-container selectors are best-effort against current ATS DOM. Console
diagnostics for tightening selectors are in the session notes (dropdown dump for Workday; suggestion
dump for GH/Lever).

**Next tuning candidates:** Workday **custom (non-EEO) question dropdowns** don't yet route through the
learned/AI batched flow (only native `<select>` + radios do); wiring `promptOption` questions into
`findUnansweredCustomQuestions` is the natural Phase 2b. iCIMS/Taleo/Ashby/SmartRecruiters remain
generic-only (adapters not built).

## Update 2026-07-01 — v1.3.0: Easy Apply refinements (banking, resume, post-submit)

Three fixes after v1.2.0 confirmed Easy Apply works:
- **Bank every question + dropdown, not just AI-answered ones.** `findUnansweredCustomQuestions`
  generalized to `findCustomQuestions(modal, includeAnswered)`; `attachAnswerCapture(modal)` is
  now attached on every step and, on any advance/submit click (Alicia's or the human's), banks
  the final value of ALL custom questions via `bankAllCustomAnswers` — so manually-typed answers
  and dropdown selections are remembered too, not only the ones Alicia generated.
- **Hidden/conditional questions ignored.** Question containers with no client rects (hidden
  steps, conditional fields) are skipped in both `findCustomQuestions` and `autoFillEeo`.
- **Resume step left to the user.** `isResumeOrDocControl()` excludes resume/CV/cover-letter
  selection from the custom-question + fill logic, and the LinkedIn resume-file auto-attach was
  removed entirely (it caused a second document to be selected → Next errored). LinkedIn
  pre-selects the most-recent resume; Alicia no longer touches it. External-ATS resume upload
  still lives in autofill.js.
- **Stop after Submit.** `isPostSubmitConfirmation()` detects the "application sent" / follow-
  company end screen (no advance/submit button present) and makes `findEasyApplyModal` return
  null, so Alicia goes quiet and waits for a new job + Easy Apply instead of poking the
  confirmation screen (which produced console errors and could touch the Follow prompt).
- Harness-verified: resume step auto-advanced without selecting a 2nd resume; a manually-chosen
  dropdown + typed answer were both banked; post-submit confirmation left untouched (Follow not
  clicked, no advance).

## Update 2026-07-01 (latest) — v1.2.0: THE fix — pierce LinkedIn's Shadow DOM

The true root cause of Easy Apply "nothing happens", confirmed by a shadow+iframe-piercing
console diagnostic on the live Serverfarm modal: **the entire Easy Apply modal (fields AND its
Next button) is rendered inside a Shadow DOM** attached to `<div id="interop-outlet">`. Shadow
trees are sealed from `document.querySelector`, so every prior content.js — which queried the
light DOM — was searching a tree that does not contain the form. (The `linkedin.com/preload`
iframe was a red herring: it's a hidden full copy of the page chrome, not the modal.)

Diagnostic proof: `firstName.path = " >> shadow(div#interop-outlet)"`, and the modal's real
"Next" also at that shadow path (the light-DOM "Next" is just job-list pagination).

Fix (content.js):
- `collectShadowRoots()` / `easyApplySearchRoots()` — gather the light document + every shadow
  root (fast path for the known `#interop-outlet` host). `findEasyApplyForm`,
  `findEasyApplyModal`, and `autoFillEeo` now search across all roots; once the modal element
  (inside the shadow root) is found, `.querySelectorAll` on it works normally within that tree.
- `ownerRoot(el)` — label[for=…] lookups resolve within the element's own shadow root instead
  of failing against the light document.
- **Polling trigger** (1.2s) added: MutationObservers on the light DOM never see shadow-tree
  mutations, so the observer alone never fired when the modal opened/changed steps. Poll +
  debounced scheduleAutoFill is the reliable driver; plus a load-time kick.
- Verified end-to-end in a browser harness that mirrors the real structure (modal inside a
  `#interop-outlet` shadow root, decoy light-DOM "Next"): auto-advanced the pre-filled contact
  step, filled an EEO select + AI-answered a question inside the shadow root, paused on an
  unknown question, banked BOTH the AI answer and the human's typed answer on the Continue
  click, advanced to the review step, never clicked Submit, never clicked the decoy Next.

## Update 2026-07-01 (late) — v1.1.0: self-healing injection + learn-from-human

Root cause of "Easy Apply does nothing" on ATS-powered postings (e.g. Lever "Apply to
Serverfarm"): the form lives in a **same-origin `linkedin.com/preload` iframe**; content
scripts don't run in subframes by default, and manifest registration never reaches frames
created before an extension reload (orphaned copies spam `chrome-extension://invalid`).
Fixes:
- `background.js` now **force-injects content.js programmatically** — per-frame on
  `webNavigation.onCompleted`/`onHistoryStateUpdated` (linkedin.com filter) and into all open
  LinkedIn tabs on `runtime.onInstalled` — so a reload needs no manual tab refresh ever again.
  content.js is wrapped in a run-once-per-frame guard, making repeat injection a no-op.
- content.js subframe support: `IS_TOP` gates page-level features to the top frame; in a
  subframe whose text reads like an application, the whole document is treated as the modal;
  question containers fall back to generic label-block detection when LinkedIn's form classes
  are absent; a load-time fill pass runs since a prebuilt iframe never mutates.
- **Learn-from-human (the Jobright loop), both content.js and autofill.js:** any question that
  learned answers + AI can't fill now PAUSES auto-advance with a "fill in and click Next —
  Alicia will remember" banner; the human's Next click banks their typed answer for future
  applications, then advancing resumes.
- Verified in a browser harness replicating the exact parent-heading/iframe-form layout:
  detection, fill, AI-partial answer, human-teach pause, banking of both answers, resume to
  Submit (never clicked).

## Update 2026-07-01 — v1.0.0: reliable auto-apply + tabbed UI

This session hardened the auto-apply pipeline end to end and reorganized the side panel.

**LinkedIn Easy Apply (`content.js`):**
- Modal detection now has fallbacks (known classes → any open `[role="dialog"]` that says
  "apply" and contains form controls), so LinkedIn class churn degrades gracefully.
- Typeahead fields (City etc.) are resolved properly: type → wait for the listbox → click the
  best suggestion. Typed-only values fail LinkedIn validation; this was a top flakiness cause.
- The fill pass is strictly sequential (contact → resume attach → custom questions → THEN
  auto-advance), so Next is never clicked while a fill/AI answer is still resolving.
- Learned-answer capture is a delegated capture-phase listener on the modal — it survives
  LinkedIn re-rendering the footer buttons. Still: AI-answered steps pause for human review;
  the human's Next click (with any edits) is what gets learned.
- If the resume upload step is empty, the stored resume file (see below) is attached.
  Submit is NEVER clicked — allowlist advance patterns only.

**External ATS (`autofill.js` — NEW FILE, replaces the inline `runUniversalAutofill`):**
- Standalone injected engine for Workday/Greenhouse/Lever/iCIMS/Ashby/etc. Reads everything
  from `chrome.storage` itself and reports back via `UNIVERSAL_FILL_RESULT` messages.
- Adds over the old version: Workday-style ARIA-combobox dropdowns, learned-answer reuse,
  batched AI answers for custom questions (pauses for review, learns from the human's
  confirming click, then resumes), resume file attach via DataTransfer, account-creation
  passwords (per-site, saved to Site Passwords), and DOM-settle waits between wizard steps.
- **Survives page navigations:** clicking "Auto-Fill Open Application" on a non-LinkedIn page
  starts a 20-minute session for that tab (`autofillSessions` in storage); `background.js`
  re-injects autofill.js on each page load in that tab while the page is the same site or a
  known ATS domain. Submit/Apply/Create-Account buttons are never clicked.
- The resume file itself (base64, ≤5 MB) is now stored as `resumeFile` when a resume is
  uploaded in the panel, so ATS file inputs can be filled.

**UI (`sidepanel.html` + tab code at the end of `sidepanel.js`):**
- Five tabs — Apply / Search / Tracker / Tools / Chat. Every feature kept, just grouped.
  Last-used tab persists (`activeTab` in storage).

**Verified:** all four JS files pass `node --check`; the autofill engine was run end-to-end
against a synthetic 4-step ATS wizard (contact + account creation + EEO select/radio/ARIA
combobox + resume file + learned/AI custom questions) in a real browser — all fields filled
correctly, AI answers paused for review, the human's edit was what got learned, filling
resumed after the confirming click, and the Submit button was never clicked. Live LinkedIn /
Workday behavior still needs Jordon's load test (agent browser tools can't use his session).

# Previous handoff (2026-06-30)

A complete handoff for continuing the **Career-mode / Job Coach** work. This session turned
the existing Chrome extension into a free, AI-powered job-search assistant for Alicia by
wiring it to the **Wagner-GPT** free backend and adding four headline capabilities.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/jordan23wagner-ops/Job-Assistant
- **Canonical local folder (LOAD THIS ONE):** `C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`
- **Sister project / backend:** Wagner-GPT PWA — `C:\Users\Jordon\Wagner-GPT\wife-gpt`
  (repo https://github.com/jordan23wagner-ops/Wagner-GPT, live https://wagner-gpt.vercel.app)

---

## ⚠️ Folder gotcha (read first)

There are **three copies** of this extension on disk. Only one is current:

| Folder | State |
|---|---|
| `Downloads/alicia_job_assistant_extension/...` | STALE (6/24) — ignore |
| `Downloads/Job-Assistant/` | STALE (6/26, git @ 676bb27) — ignore |
| **`C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`** | **CANONICAL** — all session work + GitHub origin |

Chrome must **Load unpacked** from `C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`. Earlier this session a
stale Downloads copy was loaded, so new buttons "didn't appear" — it was the wrong folder.
The Downloads copies hold nothing not in the canonical folder + GitHub (only a few old
screenshots). Safe to delete them once confirmed.

**Side-panel reload gotcha:** reloading the extension while the side panel is *open* does NOT
refresh the panel HTML. To pick up changes: close the panel → reload on `chrome://extensions`
→ reopen the panel.

---

## What this is

A Manifest V3 Chrome extension (side panel) that helps with a LinkedIn-centered job search.
Pre-existing strengths (kept): self-contained PDF/DOCX resume parsing (`parsers.js`, pure-JS
inflate, no libs), LinkedIn job scraping (`content.js`), an application tracker, themes, and a
suite of AI tools (analyze job, tailor resume, cover letter, interview prep, mock interview,
company research) — all funneled through **one function, `callGroq()`** in `sidepanel.js`.

**Why an extension, not a PWA feature:** auto-pulling LinkedIn jobs, finding people, and
auto-filling application forms require code running in the user's logged-in browser tab —
only an extension can do that. A hosted PWA cannot read linkedin.com's DOM or fill forms on
other sites. (See `flagcheck` note below.)

---

## Backend: 100% free, no API key (the "combine" with Wagner-GPT)

The extension previously required the user's own **Groq** API key. It now routes every AI call
to **Wagner-GPT's free `/api/chat`** (Ollama Cloud → NVIDIA NIM fallback), so it's **$0 for the
user** and shares the "Alicia" persona/backend.

- **The seam:** `callGroq(messages, temperature, maxTokens)` → `rawBackendCall()` POSTs
  `{ messages, newMessage, model:'auto' }` to `https://wagner-gpt.vercel.app/api/chat` and reads
  the **NDJSON delta stream** (`{"delta":"..."}\n … {"done":true}\n`), concatenating deltas into
  the one-shot string the UI expects. The last message = current user turn; everything before it
  (incl. the tool's **system prompt**) is sent as `messages` history, which Wagner-GPT forwards to
  the model with roles intact.
- The Groq key requirement and onboarding key screen are **gone** (dead onboarding code remains
  but never shows).
- Wagner-GPT added **CORS** on `/api/chat` (commit `28b5217`) — though the extension's
  `<all_urls>` host permission bypasses CORS anyway; it's there for future web callers.
- **Verified live:** the backend honors the request shape, respects system prompts, and streams
  correctly.

## Features built this session

### 1. Auto-pull + AI fit-filter — "⚡ Scan & Rank These Jobs"
On a LinkedIn **Jobs search results** page, scrapes the visible job cards and ranks every one by
fit to the saved resume (free Ollama), best first, with a colored score badge + one-line reason.
- `content.js` `scrapeJobList()` reads search-result cards (robust selector fallbacks) →
  `SCAN_JOBS` msg → `JOBS_SCANNED` reply.
- `background.js` relays `SCAN_JOBS` to the active tab (injects `content.js` if needed).
- `sidepanel.js` `rankScannedJobs()` sends resume + job list, gets strict JSON
  `[{i,score,reason}]`, sorts desc, renders. Gated on a saved resume.
- Button lives in the JOB SEARCH section under "Search LinkedIn Jobs".

### 2. People to reach out to + prepped outreach — "🤝 Find People to Reach Out To"
On a job posting, scrapes the **"Meet the hiring team"** contacts and drafts a tailored LinkedIn
outreach note per person.
- `content.js` `scrapeHiringTeam()` reads hirer cards / "who can help" module (header-text +
  class fallbacks) → `SCAN_PEOPLE` → `PEOPLE_FOUND`.
- `sidepanel.js`: button shown when a job is detected; per-person **Draft/Redraft** + **Copy**.
- **Outreach messages are editable** (a `<textarea>`) and **hard-capped at 300 chars**
  (LinkedIn connection-note limit) two ways: `enforceLimit()` cleanly trims the AI draft at a
  sentence/word boundary (never mid-word), and the textarea `maxlength` blocks editing past 300.
  Live `N / 300` counter (red at cap). The model overshoots char counts, so the limit is enforced
  in **code**, not the prompt.

### 3. Expanded autofill — contact fields + non-LinkedIn ATS
"⚡ Auto-Fill Open Application" now fills **contact fields** (first/last name, email, phone, city,
state, zip, LinkedIn, website) in addition to EEO, and works on **any site** — Greenhouse, Lever,
Workday, etc. — not just LinkedIn.
- **How it works cross-site:** the button injects a **self-contained `runAutofill(profile, eeo)`**
  into the active tab via `chrome.scripting.executeScript` (extension has `scripting` +
  `<all_urls>`). The content script only runs on linkedin.com, so injection is what enables
  external ATS.
- Matches each field by **label + name/id/autocomplete/placeholder**; fills text inputs
  (React-aware native value setter) and answers EEO selects/radios by fuzzy-matching saved
  options. **Skips already-filled and hidden fields; never submits.** Reports "Filled N fields."
- Contact info is entered in the **Application Auto-Fill** section (✎ Edit) and saved with the
  EEO answers under `profile` / `eeoPrefs` in `chrome.storage.local`.
- The original `content.js` EEO observer still **auto-fills EEO as the LinkedIn Easy Apply modal
  appears** (unchanged); the manual button does contact+EEO on any site.

## How to develop / verify

1. **Load:** `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → `C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`.
   After edits: close panel → reload → reopen panel.
2. **Syntax check:** `node --check sidepanel.js` (and content/background) catches JS errors.
3. **Verification split (IMPORTANT):** an agent CAN verify the **AI prompts** (curl the live
   `/api/chat`), **pure logic** (`node -e` unit tests — done for `enforceLimit` and field
   matching), and **syntax**. **Live LinkedIn scraping + form autofill must be load-tested by the
   user** — browser MCP tools are read-only on LinkedIn and can't use the user's session.
4. **When a scraper finds nothing:** LinkedIn churns class names. The pattern this session: paste a
   one-liner into the **LinkedIn tab** console that prints candidate selectors + a sample card's
   outerHTML, then tighten the selectors. (`scrapeJobList` / `scrapeHiringTeam`.)
5. **Commits:** the harness blocks committing on `main`, so branch → commit → `git checkout main`
   → `git merge --ff-only` → `git push origin main`. End messages with the Claude co-author line.

## Known limitations / next tweaks

- **Workday autofill:** text fields fill, but Workday's custom (non-`<select>`) dropdowns likely
  won't — they're not real form controls. Greenhouse/Lever should fill cleanly.
- **Scan & Rank** ranks on card-level data (title/company/location) only — a fast relevance pass.
  Deeper per-job fit uses the existing "Analyze Job" tool. Could fetch each job's description for
  richer scoring (more requests = more LinkedIn rate-limit risk).
- **People** only surfaces the job page's "Meet the hiring team" (low risk). Broader people-search
  (company employees) would need navigating company pages — more account risk; not built.
- **Scraper selectors** are best-effort against current LinkedIn DOM and will need occasional
  upkeep as classes change.
- **Account safety:** kept human-in-the-loop (drafts + autofill, never auto-submit, no aggressive
  scraping) to protect Alicia's real LinkedIn account.

## The `flagcheck` repo (reference, not used directly)

`jordan23wagner-ops/flagcheck` is a **paid** MCP server (Anthropic API + x402 $0.01/req crypto)
that returns structured job analysis (A–F grade, ATS score, red flags, salary, match). We do
**not** call its endpoint ($0/month rule). Its analysis **prompts** (`api/scan-job.js`,
`api/analyze.js`) are good source material if you want to add a structured "grade this job" card
to the extension — port the prompt, run it on the free Wagner-GPT backend.

---

## What's next (options)

1. **Tune autofill** for whatever ATS fields don't catch (need the field label + site).
2. **Structured job-grade card** in the extension (port `flagcheck` prompts → free backend).
3. **Richer Scan & Rank** (fetch descriptions for deeper fit) — mind rate limits.
4. **Back to Wagner-GPT PWA:** held phases **5 (Deep Research)** and **6 (Voice loop)**, now
   unblockable via the Vercel preview-deploy workflow (push a feature branch → preview URL with
   real `/api` → verify → merge).
