# Job-Assistant ("Alicia AI") — Engineering Handoff

## Update 2026-07-01 (late) — v1.1.0: self-healing injection + learn-from-human

Root cause of "Easy Apply does nothing" on ATS-powered postings (e.g. Lever "Apply to
Serverfarm"): the form lives in a **same-origin `linkedin.com/preload` iframe**; content
scripts don't run in subframes by default, and manifest registration never reaches frames
created before an extension reload (orphaned copies spam `chrome-extension://invalid`).
Fixes:
- `background.js` now **force-injects content.js programmatically** — per-frame on
  `webNavigation.onCompleted`/`onHistoryStateUpdated` (linkedin.com filter) and into all open
  LinkedIn tabs on `runtime.onInstalled` — so a reload needs no manual tab refresh ever again.
  content.js is wrapped in a run-once-per-frame guard, making repeat injection a no-op.
- content.js subframe support: `IS_TOP` gates page-level features to the top frame; in a
  subframe whose text reads like an application, the whole document is treated as the modal;
  question containers fall back to generic label-block detection when LinkedIn's form classes
  are absent; a load-time fill pass runs since a prebuilt iframe never mutates.
- **Learn-from-human (the Jobright loop), both content.js and autofill.js:** any question that
  learned answers + AI can't fill now PAUSES auto-advance with a "fill in and click Next —
  Alicia will remember" banner; the human's Next click banks their typed answer for future
  applications, then advancing resumes.
- Verified in a browser harness replicating the exact parent-heading/iframe-form layout:
  detection, fill, AI-partial answer, human-teach pause, banking of both answers, resume to
  Submit (never clicked).

## Update 2026-07-01 — v1.0.0: reliable auto-apply + tabbed UI

This session hardened the auto-apply pipeline end to end and reorganized the side panel.

**LinkedIn Easy Apply (`content.js`):**
- Modal detection now has fallbacks (known classes → any open `[role="dialog"]` that says
  "apply" and contains form controls), so LinkedIn class churn degrades gracefully.
- Typeahead fields (City etc.) are resolved properly: type → wait for the listbox → click the
  best suggestion. Typed-only values fail LinkedIn validation; this was a top flakiness cause.
- The fill pass is strictly sequential (contact → resume attach → custom questions → THEN
  auto-advance), so Next is never clicked while a fill/AI answer is still resolving.
- Learned-answer capture is a delegated capture-phase listener on the modal — it survives
  LinkedIn re-rendering the footer buttons. Still: AI-answered steps pause for human review;
  the human's Next click (with any edits) is what gets learned.
- If the resume upload step is empty, the stored resume file (see below) is attached.
  Submit is NEVER clicked — allowlist advance patterns only.

**External ATS (`autofill.js` — NEW FILE, replaces the inline `runUniversalAutofill`):**
- Standalone injected engine for Workday/Greenhouse/Lever/iCIMS/Ashby/etc. Reads everything
  from `chrome.storage` itself and reports back via `UNIVERSAL_FILL_RESULT` messages.
- Adds over the old version: Workday-style ARIA-combobox dropdowns, learned-answer reuse,
  batched AI answers for custom questions (pauses for review, learns from the human's
  confirming click, then resumes), resume file attach via DataTransfer, account-creation
  passwords (per-site, saved to Site Passwords), and DOM-settle waits between wizard steps.
- **Survives page navigations:** clicking "Auto-Fill Open Application" on a non-LinkedIn page
  starts a 20-minute session for that tab (`autofillSessions` in storage); `background.js`
  re-injects autofill.js on each page load in that tab while the page is the same site or a
  known ATS domain. Submit/Apply/Create-Account buttons are never clicked.
- The resume file itself (base64, ≤5 MB) is now stored as `resumeFile` when a resume is
  uploaded in the panel, so ATS file inputs can be filled.

**UI (`sidepanel.html` + tab code at the end of `sidepanel.js`):**
- Five tabs — Apply / Search / Tracker / Tools / Chat. Every feature kept, just grouped.
  Last-used tab persists (`activeTab` in storage).

**Verified:** all four JS files pass `node --check`; the autofill engine was run end-to-end
against a synthetic 4-step ATS wizard (contact + account creation + EEO select/radio/ARIA
combobox + resume file + learned/AI custom questions) in a real browser — all fields filled
correctly, AI answers paused for review, the human's edit was what got learned, filling
resumed after the confirming click, and the Submit button was never clicked. Live LinkedIn /
Workday behavior still needs Jordon's load test (agent browser tools can't use his session).

# Previous handoff (2026-06-30)

A complete handoff for continuing the **Career-mode / Job Coach** work. This session turned
the existing Chrome extension into a free, AI-powered job-search assistant for Alicia by
wiring it to the **Wagner-GPT** free backend and adding four headline capabilities.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/jordan23wagner-ops/Job-Assistant
- **Canonical local folder (LOAD THIS ONE):** `C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`
- **Sister project / backend:** Wagner-GPT PWA — `C:\Users\Jordon\Wagner-GPT\wife-gpt`
  (repo https://github.com/jordan23wagner-ops/Wagner-GPT, live https://wagner-gpt.vercel.app)

---

## ⚠️ Folder gotcha (read first)

There are **three copies** of this extension on disk. Only one is current:

| Folder | State |
|---|---|
| `Downloads/alicia_job_assistant_extension/...` | STALE (6/24) — ignore |
| `Downloads/Job-Assistant/` | STALE (6/26, git @ 676bb27) — ignore |
| **`C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`** | **CANONICAL** — all session work + GitHub origin |

Chrome must **Load unpacked** from `C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`. Earlier this session a
stale Downloads copy was loaded, so new buttons "didn't appear" — it was the wrong folder.
The Downloads copies hold nothing not in the canonical folder + GitHub (only a few old
screenshots). Safe to delete them once confirmed.

**Side-panel reload gotcha:** reloading the extension while the side panel is *open* does NOT
refresh the panel HTML. To pick up changes: close the panel → reload on `chrome://extensions`
→ reopen the panel.

## What this is

A Manifest V3 Chrome extension (side panel) that helps with a LinkedIn-centered job search.
Pre-existing strengths (kept): self-contained PDF/DOCX resume parsing (`parsers.js`, pure-JS
inflate, no libs), LinkedIn job scraping (`content.js`), an application tracker, themes, and a
suite of AI tools (analyze job, tailor resume, cover letter, interview prep, mock interview,
company research) — all funneled through **one function, `callGroq()`** in `sidepanel.js`.

**Why an extension, not a PWA feature:** auto-pulling LinkedIn jobs, finding people, and
auto-filling application forms require code running in the user's logged-in browser tab —
only an extension can do that. A hosted PWA cannot read linkedin.com's DOM or fill forms on
other sites. (See `flagcheck` note below.)

---

## Backend: 100% free, no API key (the "combine" with Wagner-GPT)

The extension previously required the user's own **Groq** API key. It now routes every AI call
to **Wagner-GPT's free `/api/chat`** (Ollama Cloud → NVIDIA NIM fallback), so it's **$0 for the
user** and shares the "Alicia" persona/backend.

- **The seam:** `callGroq(messages, temperature, maxTokens)` → `rawBackendCall()` POSTs
  `{ messages, newMessage, model:'auto' }` to `https://wagner-gpt.vercel.app/api/chat` and reads
  the **NDJSON delta stream** (`{"delta":"..."}\n … {"done":true}\n`), concatenating deltas into
  the one-shot string the UI expects. The last message = current user turn; everything before it
  (incl. the tool's **system prompt**) is sent as `messages` history, which Wagner-GPT forwards to
  the model with roles intact.
- The Groq key requirement and onboarding key screen are **gone** (dead onboarding code remains
  but never shows).
- Wagner-GPT added **CORS** on `/api/chat` (commit `28b5217`) — though the extension's
  `<all_urls>` host permission bypasses CORS anyway; it's there for future web callers.
- **Verified live:** the backend honors the request shape, respects system prompts, and streams
  correctly.

## Features built this session

### 1. Auto-pull + AI fit-filter — "⚡ Scan & Rank These Jobs"
On a LinkedIn **Jobs search results** page, scrapes the visible job cards and ranks every one by
fit to the saved resume (free Ollama), best first, with a colored score badge + one-line reason.
- `content.js` `scrapeJobList()` reads search-result cards (robust selector fallbacks) →
  `SCAN_JOBS` msg → `JOBS_SCANNED` reply.
- `background.js` relays `SCAN_JOBS` to the active tab (injects `content.js` if needed).
- `sidepanel.js` `rankScannedJobs()` sends resume + job list, gets strict JSON
  `[{i,score,reason}]`, sorts desc, renders. Gated on a saved resume.
- Button lives in the JOB SEARCH section under "Search LinkedIn Jobs".

### 2. People to reach out to + prepped outreach — "🤝 Find People to Reach Out To"
On a job posting, scrapes the **"Meet the hiring team"** contacts and drafts a tailored LinkedIn
outreach note per person.
- `content.js` `scrapeHiringTeam()` reads hirer cards / "who can help" module (header-text +
  class fallbacks) → `SCAN_PEOPLE` → `PEOPLE_FOUND`.
- `sidepanel.js`: button shown when a job is detected; per-person **Draft/Redraft** + **Copy**.
- **Outreach messages are editable** (a `<textarea>`) and **hard-capped at 300 chars**
  (LinkedIn connection-note limit) two ways: `enforceLimit()` cleanly trims the AI draft at a
  sentence/word boundary (never mid-word), and the textarea `maxlength` blocks editing past 300.
  Live `N / 300` counter (red at cap). The model overshoots char counts, so the limit is enforced
  in **code**, not the prompt.

### 3. Expanded autofill — contact fields + non-LinkedIn ATS
"⚡ Auto-Fill Open Application" now fills **contact fields** (first/last name, email, phone, city,
state, zip, LinkedIn, website) in addition to EEO, and works on **any site** — Greenhouse, Lever,
Workday, etc. — not just LinkedIn.
- **How it works cross-site:** the button injects a **self-contained `runAutofill(profile, eeo)`**
  into the active tab via `chrome.scripting.executeScript` (extension has `scripting` +
  `<all_urls>`). The content script only runs on linkedin.com, so injection is what enables
  external ATS.
- Matches each field by **label + name/id/autocomplete/placeholder**; fills text inputs
  (React-aware native value setter) and answers EEO selects/radios by fuzzy-matching saved
  options. **Skips already-filled and hidden fields; never submits.** Reports "Filled N fields."
- Contact info is entered in the **Application Auto-Fill** section (✎ Edit) and saved with the
  EEO answers under `profile` / `eeoPrefs` in `chrome.storage.local`.
- The original `content.js` EEO observer still **auto-fills EEO as the LinkedIn Easy Apply modal
  appears** (unchanged); the manual button does contact+EEO on any site.

## How to develop / verify

1. **Load:** `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → `C:\Users\Jordon\Job-Assistant`.
   After edits: close panel → reload → reopen panel.
2. **Syntax check:** `node --check sidepanel.js` (and content/background) catches JS errors.
3. **Verification split (IMPORTANT):** an agent CAN verify the **AI prompts** (curl the live
   `/api/chat`), **pure logic** (`node -e` unit tests — done for `enforceLimit` and field
   matching), and **syntax**. **Live LinkedIn scraping + form autofill must be load-tested by the
   user** — browser MCP tools are read-only on LinkedIn and can't use the user's session.
4. **When a scraper finds nothing:** LinkedIn churns class names. The pattern this session: paste a
   one-liner into the **LinkedIn tab** console that prints candidate selectors + a sample card's
   outerHTML, then tighten the selectors. (`scrapeJobList` / `scrapeHiringTeam`.)
5. **Commits:** the harness blocks committing on `main`, so branch → commit → `git checkout main`
   → `git merge --ff-only` → `git push origin main`. End messages with the Claude co-author line.

## Known limitations / next tweaks

- **Workday autofill:** text fields fill, but Workday's custom (non-`<select>`) dropdowns likely
  won't — they're not real form controls. Greenhouse/Lever should fill cleanly.
- **Scan & Rank** ranks on card-level data (title/company/location) only — a fast relevance pass.
  Deeper per-job fit uses the existing "Analyze Job" tool. Could fetch each job's description for
  richer scoring (more requests = more LinkedIn rate-limit risk).
- **People** only surfaces the job page's "Meet the hiring team" (low risk). Broader people-search
  (company employees) would need navigating company pages — more account risk; not built.
- **Scraper selectors** are best-effort against current LinkedIn DOM and will need occasional
  upkeep as classes change.
- **Account safety:** kept human-in-the-loop (drafts + autofill, never auto-submit, no aggressive
  scraping) to protect Alicia's real LinkedIn account.

## The `flagcheck` repo (reference, not used directly)

`jordan23wagner-ops/flagcheck` is a **paid** MCP server (Anthropic API + x402 $0.01/req crypto)
that returns structured job analysis (A–F grade, ATS score, red flags, salary, match). We do
**not** call its endpoint ($0/month rule). Its analysis **prompts** (`api/scan-job.js`,
`api/analyze.js`) are good source material if you want to add a structured "grade this job" card
to the extension — port the prompt, run it on the free Wagner-GPT backend.

---

## What's next (options)

1. **Tune autofill** for whatever ATS fields don't catch (need the field label + site).
2. **Structured job-grade card** in the extension (port `flagcheck` prompts → free backend).
3. **Richer Scan & Rank** (fetch descriptions for deeper fit) — mind rate limits.
4. **Back to Wagner-GPT PWA:** held phases **5 (Deep Research)** and **6 (Voice loop)**, now
   unblockable via the Vercel preview-deploy workflow (push a feature branch → preview URL with
   real `/api` → verify → merge).
